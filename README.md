Ideas:

Transportation, if the user gets in a wreck, An AI algorithm sends an automatic alert to 911 and emergency services.
Entertainment, An AI application is on tv, and is able to view what the user has been watching. Then, after it has been collecting that data for a bit, the user could ask and recieve show recommendations.
Healthcare, There is an AI smell tracker that tracks the smell in bedrooms/bathrooms. The Ai has a sensor that tells us we need to clean that room or do something about it.

Chosen Idea: Transportation, if the user gets in a wreck, An AI algorithm sends an automatic alert to 911 and emergency services.
