Decide what type of AI/ML will be used (e.g., classification, NLP, regression, clustering):
Classification. AI will determine whether incoming sensor data indicates a crash or non-crash event. The AI will analyze data such as deceleration patterns, impact force, and acceleration.

Research datasets — real or simulated:
Simulated and real. AI can start off learning through a variety of patterns set up by simulated tests. When the AI is put into action, it can continue to learn through its experiences to improve and adapt.


Discuss model limitations and potential risks
Model Limitation: 
When the AI is in early testing, it might either detect accidents that might just be a bump in the road, or not detect an accident that doesn’t think it is significant enough to warrant action.
Models may not generalize well to real accidents.
The model may misclassify complex or noisy sensor patterns.
Potential Risks:
Automatically tracking information of drivers. If mishandled, this could lead to privacy breaches or unauthorized tracking.
Overreliance of users could be a problem. Drivers or passengers may assume emergency response is guaranteed.
